Mucous
------


If you want accented characters, you'll need to do the following:

Copy the sitecustomize.py file to your /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages/ 
directory. 

If you already have such a file, add the contents of mine to yours.


If you don't have Mucipher installed you'll need to do so. (if you compiled museek yourself, SWIG needed to be available.)
It is absolutely necessary to allow Mucous to connect to the Museek Daemon. 
Download it here: http://thegraveyard.org/files/pymucipher-0.0.1.tar.gz
Extract the tarball, and as Root or sudo, run:
python setup.py install
You'll need GCC, Python and SWIG to install it. "
