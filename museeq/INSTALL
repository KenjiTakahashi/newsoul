Museeq's Qmake compilation instructions

Requirements:
 * The Mucipher source should be in the parent directory ( ../Mucipher )
   If it is not, place it there or modify the museeq.pro to point at it.
 * Install QT 4.x Development packages, if needed, which should include:
   * qmake, lrelease, lupdate, moc, uic
 * If you have Qt 3.x installed, you'll need to configure your paths and
   QTDIR to point at the QT4 directory, so the tools and compilation will
   work.
 * Other required utilities include:
   * make
   * g++ ( GCC for C++ )

Qmake Options:

 CONFIG OPTIONS
 * QSA: Scripting Support
 * BINRELOC: Binary Relocation
 * TRAYICON: Compile Trayicon

 OTHER OPTIONS
 * PREFIX: If you do not use BINRELOC, you should set PREFIX to whatever
   path museeq will be installed into. (Same path as make's INSTALL_ROOT)
   PREFIX defaults to /usr

Example Qmake commands:
 * qmake "CONFIG += BINRELOC"  <- in doubt, USE THIS
 
 * qmake "CONFIG += QSA BINRELOC TRAYICON"
 * qmake "CONFIG += QSA" "PREFIX+=/usr"
 * qmake "PREFIX=/usr/local"
 * qmake

Make Options:
 * INSTALL_ROOT: the prefix of the path where museeq will be installed
   INSTALL_ROOT must be set, or it'll be installed in /bin and /share
