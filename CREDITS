Below is for Museek-plus (post-svn) 
-----------------------------------

SeeSchloss
   For the room searching function (now-defunct) in museekd and museeq
   and for writing the OpenSource Soulfind Soulseek-Server, which, among other
   things, allows much greater flexibility in client programming and testing, 
   without the fears of damaging Soulseek, itself or getting banned.
Daelstorm
   For coding new features into museekd, muscan, and museeq, and for writing mucous and musetup-gtk.
Belegdol
   For providing the GCC 4.1 compile fix to museeq and for his Fedora Core RPMs and Polish Translation.
stericho
   For the Gentoo ebuilds.
Le_Vert
   For the Debian / Ubuntu packages, the subversion repository, and the Trac, and French Translation
Requiem1348
   For the Italian Translation.
